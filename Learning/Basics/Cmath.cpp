 * In-notes
 * --------
 *
 * I have told you how do they work but to use them you have to either y = <function> or cout << <function>
 *
 * there are so many so if you wanna check them you can check here: https://cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/#google_vignette
 *
 * Next: Conditionals > "if-else"; Let's go boi/gurl we've completed super-basics!
 * Practice program: "AreaOfCircle"; It's just for fun you can check it if you'd like!
