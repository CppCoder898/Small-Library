 * In-notes
 * --------
 *
 * Const makes any varaible constant, meaning they cant be changed at all.
 * Also if you're using a const, i recommend using caps for name cuz it just fits with it.
 * It's not neccesarry tho, use whatever you like!
 *
 * Next: "NameSpaces"; fun fact: these notes were 1 line before but I didn't liked it.
