/*
 * In-notes
 * --------
 * 
 * First line is including input-out stream. a header file, which allows it to run program and have input and output. (#include<iostream>)
 * The second line is using a namespace std, which means a lot of keywords require 'std::' which wont be required, if we use it.
 *
 * The int main is the function where all code is executed with in two curly brackets.
 *
 * std::cout << is standard::character output << the 2 less than are called "Insertation Operator",
 * used to print multiple things with one cout like endl which means endline or you can print variables.
 * 
 * return 0; is used to end function just end it 
 *
 * Bonus tip you can use '\n' in the cout to end line without even << but if you're writing like '\n' and not "<text>\n" you will need <<
 *
 * Next: "Variables";
