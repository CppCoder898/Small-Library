 *
 * In-notes
 * --------
 * 
 * What are constructors?
 * They are to make initialization easier for objects.
 * 
 * Also, yes I copied the code, lol.
 * 2 Types of constructors.
 * 
 * 1.Default
 * This guy is there if you don't make a new constructor.
 * This guy is for: student1.blah = "bruh"; type initialization.
 * But if you make a new one this one goes so you have to make it like:
 * 
 * Student() {
 * 
 * }
 * or it won't work.
 * 
 * 2.Parameterized
 * This guy isn't always there you have to call him.
 * It takes the values, just like how normal function does.
 * When we say name = n; the name we are talking about is object's name. this is important.
 * 
 * The constructor doesn't have a return type, and has same name as class.
 * 
 * Next: "THIS"; looks like it's about THIS.
